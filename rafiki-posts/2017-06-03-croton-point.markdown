With Ultimate season in full swing and plenty of stuff to do around town,
it's been pretty hectic for me of late. So when the opportunity arose to
spend the night outdoors at Croton Point Park, I jumped at it. By that I
mean I emailed my entire Ultimate team asking if anyone would camp with me
and then (somewhat coincidentally) hung out with a bunch of _other_ Ultimate
folks for the evening and following morning. It was rather different from
my recent solo camping adventures, and in a lovely,
small-child-and-smores-filled kind of way.

I hopped on the Metro North (Hudson Line) to Croton-on-Harmon, from whence
it is an extremely short bike ride (probably walkable, even) into Croton
Point Park, which protrudes from the mainland out onto the Hudson.

A few exciting adventures:

* I missed my planned train, so I ended up arriving at camp a bit after
sunset. That meant I got to practice finding and setting up a campsite by
headlamp. To be honest, it was much less scary/intimidating than I'd
anticipated. The hardest part was finding trees that weren't swamped with
poison ivy I'd have to slog through, but once that was done, setting up my
whole hammock, bug net, underquilt, and sleeping bag was a breeze.
* Just last week I used the REI annual sale as an excuse to finally upgrade
to a water-resistant down bag, and it is _amazing_. It packs down to a
little smaller than my previous bag, is rated to about twenty degrees
cooler, and generally kept me warm and comfy all night long!
* I ended up spending a fair bit of time outdoors without the protection of
my hammock's bug net, so I was very grateful to have long sleeves and
pants.
* Check yourself for ticks, kids! It's looking to be a tick-heavy season,
and there is no tick-borne disease that you want.



Normally I would have a whole slew of things I'd plan to do differently
next time, but to be honest, this was such a lovely evening, night, and
morning that I can't come up with anything at the moment.

My [bike](2017-04-08-folding-bike-adventures.html) came on the adventure
with me - check out its view out the window on the train!

AND as a bonus, I learned that my front tire is super reflective. This
makes me much happier about riding around Manhattan at night.

Other than that, Croton-on-Hudson has a gorgeous mural inside the train
station:
