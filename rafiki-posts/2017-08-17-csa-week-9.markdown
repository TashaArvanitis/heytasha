# Sad news
Unfortunately, in the craziness that was last Thursday, I 100% forgot to
pick up my share for the week. Honestly, given that I was out of town
Friday evening through late Sunday, worse things have happened, and luckily
I'd put away enough leftovers from previous weeks to get by. In other
exciting news, my phone now beeps alarmingly at me on Thursday afternoons.
