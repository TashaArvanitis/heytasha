title: CSA Week 7

## Meet the characters

This week's share contained:

* A large head of lettuce
* A smallish head of red cabbage
* Small box of cherry tomatoes
* One cucumber
* One zucchini
* One summer squash
* A head of fennel
* Some leeks
* Another long skinny eggplant

Vegetable of the week: leeks! Okay, I knew what these were before but I'd
certainly never gone out of my way to find or cook with them.

## Keeping up with the squashes
As I mentioned [last week](2017-07-27-csa-week-6.html), I was falling a bit
behind on button squashes, so this week, with yet another gear-shaped
squash occupying my vegetable drawer, it was time to whip up something
squashily delicious! I found a very simple recipe for [squash with
basil](http://www.foodrenegade.com/buttery-patty-pan-squash-with-basil-recipe/)
and decided to give it a try. Sure enough, it turned out buttery and basily
and delightful. 9/10 amazing with fresh squash. Bonus points for using some
of my hyperactive basil from [week 1](2017-06-12-csa-week-1.html).

Here's what that looked like right before going into the oven:

## The rest of the share

In no particular order, the rest of the share became:

* A picnic salad for three. Even a particularly picky friend enjoyed it!
Honey mustard dressing with apple, lots of lettuce, and some chopped carrot
really laid down a solid base, and almonds, tomatoes, and cranberries
rounded it off wonderfully. Also about seven or eight more servings of
miscellaneous salads from that enormous head of lettuce. Yum!
* Tomato and cucumber salad, with a standard olive oil and vinegar
dressing.
* A questionable leek and fennel stir fry. I think that if I throw it on
top of an over easy egg, the yolk subdues some of the flavors a little and
makes it palatable.
* A [turkey and cabbage
skillet](http://www.primaverakitchen.com/ground-turkey-cabbage-skillet/) to
use up my two heads of cabbage. This was delicious fresh and also pretty
tasty when reheated.
* Smoothies galore with the zucchini and cucumber.

## Uh oh, leftovers again!

Left over when I picked up my next share were:

* Two long skinny eggplants
* Two zucchinis
* A summer squash
* One leek
