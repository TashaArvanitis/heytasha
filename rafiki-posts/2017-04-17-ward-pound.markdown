Since I'm now the proud owner of a mostly-functional
[folding bike](2017-04-08-folding-bike-adventures.html), it seemed only
right to head out of the city on one of these beautiful spring nights and
test out the full train-bike-camp-bike-train circuit. I decided to head to
[Ward Pound Ridge Reservation](http://parks.westchestergov.com/ward-pound-ridge-reservation),
as I'd heard of it in the context of amateur astronomy and they allow
camping in lean tos or camp sites.

I ended up taking a relatively early train to Katonah (the Harlem line),
and from there I bought dinner, packed up my backpack one last time
(perhaps two or three, just to be sure), and embarked on the
[45-minute ride](https://goo.gl/maps/HnZChzcC8PC2) to the park.  Most of the
ride was along a two-lane 40-45 mph road, but the shoulder was quite
generous in most places and I felt fairly comfortable the whole way there.

I reached the campsite with plenty of time to spare before sunset, so I set
up camp, ate dinner, and then retreated to within my bug net to escape the
buzzing mosquitos and enjoy a couple books I'd brought (in ebook form).

I ended up getting something like nine hours of lovely sleep, waking up
twice briefly to admire the eerie shadows cast by the full moon (great
timing! Thanks for the suggestion [past Tasha](2016-10-12-harriman-trip.html)).
In the morning, I hung around enjoying the spring weather, then packed up
camp and coasted downhill to Katonah. (By the time I hit my first uphill at
around mile two of six, my hands felt like ice cubes from the morning air
and windchill. I don't think I've ever been so excited for a steep ascent.)

All told, I was back at work by 9am the next morning - not bad for a
weeknight adventure!

Things I'd do differently next time:

* Bring gloves for the morning bike ride back to the train station.
* Fix my front derailleur so I have higher gears and can actually pedal on
the way down long hills.
* Pack my dinner in advance. This probably would have saved me 20ish
minutes in Katonah, meaning I could leave the city a little later and still
have plenty of time to set up camp.

A few early-morning photos; can you spot the camouflaged bike?

Obligatory notes on [solo camping](http://blog.rei.com/camp/joys-solo-camping/):

* Double-check your gear before heading out - you have no buddy's gear as
backup if something doesn't work for you.
* Always designate a Responsible Adult (thanks Ben!) to whom you send info
on where/when you're camping and with whom you promise to touch base in the
morning. This person is responsible for calling search and rescue or local
police if they then can't reach you at the pre-scheduled time.
* If anyone asks "oh, so you're camping alone?" the answer is NEVER yes. I
personally favor "no, I'm just meeting some friends up ahead."
