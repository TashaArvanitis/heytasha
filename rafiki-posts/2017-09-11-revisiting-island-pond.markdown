title: Island Pond, revisited
---

Once upon a time nearly a year ago, I visited [Island
Pond](2016-10-12-harriman-trip.html), a lovely site in Harriman State Park.
This past weekend I decided to head back in that direction, this time with
a bike to get around. Originally I had planned to hike in to one of the
lean-tos in the park, but a combination of nasty hills and private roads
made that tricky this time around. Next time I have an alternate route that
I'll try, but this time around I instead ended up back near Island Pond,
and camped within sight of the Appalachian Trail. It was, once again,
beautiful, especially in the early morning with the half moon in the
sky.

Recently I started sleeping in my hammock indoors as well as out, which has
entailed a few adjustments to ridgeline length and lantern placement and
such. This necessitated some readjustments of my underquilt for
my new hang, and Island Pond was my first chance to do so. I won't say I
love the fiddling it takes to adjust and check the fit of my quilt, but
I do like the feeling of snuggling up in a warm bed at night!

Lessons learned from this particular trip:

* Bring gloves for the downhill ride in the morning.
* Double check any route google suggests for private roads.
* Even if the weather looks good, a windbreaker is nice for the biking
portion of a trip.
* One of these days I'm going to get panniers for my bike, which will
hopefully make biking with lots of camping gear a little easier.
* On a night that only gets down to the upper forties, a thick down
sleeping bag may be a bit too much.
