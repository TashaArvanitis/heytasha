## Meet the characters

This week's share contained:

* A large head of lettuce
* A head of cabbage
* Two poblano peppers
* Two jalapeños
* An onion
* A small box of tomatillos
* Two sweet corn cobs
* A large tomato

## Vegetable of the week: tomatillos
I had never encountered these before, so my first thought was "weird
underripe tomato." Sure enough, tomatillos and tomatoes are both members of
the nightshade family, but other than that the two are fairly distinct! It
was fun to play and cook with these for the first time. I had no idea that
underneath the husk would be sticky, or that the inside would be so
fig-like. Turns out they're really tasty, especially in a green sauce like
salsa verde.

## Salsa verde time!
Since I had a box of tomatillos, it seemed only right to whip up some salsa
verde. I very loosely followed [this
recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/94028/tomatillo-salsa-verde/).
I substituted a jalapeño for the serrano pepper, used only about 10 oz of
tomatillos, substituted dried oregano instead of fresh, and omitted the
cilantro because I didn't have it on hand. In total, I netted probably four
cups of salsa verde, of which I used almost two to [bake some
chicken](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/salsa_verde_chicken_bake/).
That turned out delicious despite the fact that I overcooked a bit - for
some reason my salsa verde never got bubbly, but the chicken was certainly
done! Served on top of some white rice, the meal as a whole was delicious.
7/10, probably better next time if I take it out after the appropriate
amount of time.



## The rest of the share

In no particular order, the rest of the share became:

* A vegetable soup when I came down with a cold. That used up some onion
scraps, the remaining carrot, and some pasta and felt positively wonderful
on my sore throat.
* Tomato salad! Having grown up in a family that grew and ate tomatoes
regularly, summer just isn't summer without simple, fresh tomato salad.
* Corn on the cob. I have a hard time bringing myself to do anything else
with fresh sweet corn: plain corn on the cob is just too tasty.
* [Lettuce soup](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/lettuce-soup-231995).
As feared, I am drowning in leafy greens and not much in the mood for
salad, so lettuce soup seemed like a solid choice. Plus it's easy to freeze
for future consumption. I didn't have coriander handy, so I used a garam
masala instead, and it turned out quite tasty.

## Leftovers

At the end of this week, which included a couple of stressful days where I
wasn't in the mood for cooking, I had the following vegetables still in my
fridge:

* Two poblano and one jalapeño pepper
* Half an onion
* Two thirds of a large tomato
* A head of cabbage
* A few last leaves of lettuce

Of these, I'm not really worried about the cabbage and onion; those will
keep.
