## Meet the characters

This week's share contained:

* A head of cauliflower
* Two banana squashes (thankfully relatively small)
* A bunch of parsley
* A box of tomatillos
* Five poblano peppers
* Two mysterious red peppers, possibly serrano?
* Another bag of fresh tomatoes

## Vegetable of the week: cauliflower
I had broccoli a few weeks ago, and now it's the turn of its cousin,
cauliflower.

## The rest of the share

Nothing yet!
