title: CSA Week 5
---

I was out of town for a few weeks, thus the jump in CSA week count. And wow
am I excited to have access to farm-fresh vegetables again! That's not
something you get much of when camping in Alaska.

## Week 5: meet the characters

This week's share contained:

* An *enormous* head of lettuce
* One giant head (is that what those are called?) of fennel
* One eggplant
* A bunch of green onions
* Two smallish eggplants
* Two summer squashes and a zucchini
* Small box of cherry tomatoes

Fun fact of the week: eggplants can look like this:

## Discovering fennel

I'll admit, I think I've only cooked with fennel once in the past (and
honestly wasn't that impressed with the result). So presented with an
enormous head of fennel, it took some googling to find some good uses for
this strange herb-vegetable crossover. I found a tasty looking recipe for
[fennel risotto](https://www.nonnabox.com/risotto-with-fennel/), and went
for it. I ended up using a bit more stock to get the risotto to *al dente*
than the recipe suggested, and as usual I was a bit too lazy to finely chop
everything, so the result is a totally delicious risotto with smallish
chunks of fennel bulb and onion. Risotto is hard to screw up, and I love
the smell of chopped fennel hanging in my kitchen, so I'd give this a 7/10.

That still leaves (see what I did there?) the stalks and fronds, which I
respectively treated like celery and used to top various salads. It's a
great way to add a little subtle flavor to a quick meal.

## The rest of the share

In no particular order, the rest of the share became:

* Several small salads
* Snack tomatoes (those things are addictive)
* A smoothie with lettuce, apple, and pineapple. I wasn't sure what to
expect, but it turned out delicious.
* Another smoothie with the summer squash, an apple, some blueberries, and
chocolate protein powder. To be honest the protein powder kind of drowned
out all the other flavors, which wasn't optimal. I'll have to continue
working on balancing flavors, I guess.
* [Ratatouille](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/ratatouille-12164)
with the eggplant and zucchini, along with some of the
tomatoes and some onion from elsewhere.
* Several breakfasts of wilted lettuce with egg and miscellaneous spices.
