title: CSA Week 6
---

## Meet the characters

This week's share contained:

* A medium-sized head of lettuce (phew!)
* A smallish head of cabbage
* Another long skinny eggplant
* One zucchini
* One summer squash
* Two button squashes
* Four gorgeous carrots
* Small box of cherry tomatoes

Vegetable of the week: I'd never before seen a button squash, so this was
exciting to figure out:

Thanks as always to [Katchkie Farm](http://katchkiefarm.com/) for a
wonderful CSA!


## Let's talk salad
To be honest when I picked up this week's share, I was still working
through the giant lettuce from last week's. Falling behind on a CSA is hard
to recover from, and desperate times call for desperate measures, so... it
was time to bust out *lots* of salads. This week's featured salad contained
lettuce (if you hold a few leaves in one hand and cut chunks off with
scissors in the other, you get a really nice salad texture), apple chunks,
pumpkin seeds, and cranberries, with a honey mustard dressing.

## The rest of the share

In no particular order, the rest of the share became:

* Smoothies to use up the zucchini and some of the lettuce.
* Several breakfasts of wilted lettuce with egg and miscellaneous spices.
* Boiled carrots with some light seasoning. With carrots this fresh,
they're just plain delicious no matter what you do to them.
* Leftover button squash - uh oh, I'm falling ever further behind!
