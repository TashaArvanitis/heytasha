title: Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) Week 1
---

This year, for the first time, I signed up to get a share of Community
Supported Agriculture (CSA). That means that once a week from June to
November I pick up a bag full of farm-fresh vegetables that happened to be
ready for harvest that week. In other words, I get fresh vegetables from
close by, reducing the carbon impact of the food I eat, and I directly
support a small farm.  Furthermore, the way most CSAs are structured, I pay
at the beginning of the season, which means that the small farm in question
has a good idea of how much it needs to plant for the year, and has the
startup money to get the ball rolling.

After a bit of research, I chose to get my share from [Katchkie
Farm](http://katchkiefarm.com/) for a couple of reasons: they offered
pickup close to home at a time that is convenient to me, and they have an
unusual "small share," which means I get only 4-7 different kinds of
vegetable per share, instead of 7-10. As someone who lives on my own, that
means that I have a fighting chance of actually _finishing_ one week's
vegetables before I pick up the next batch.

I'm excited to have access to delicious farm-fresh vegetables for the
season, and to branch out a bit in my cooking to find recipes for
vegetables I don't normally buy. I'll be the first to admit I'm not a chef,
but so far I've been having fun with consuming my CSA share, so I thought
I'd post info here on the off chance others find it interesting.

## Week 1: meet the characters

I picked up my first share last Thursday (June 8), and it contained:

* Around 7 radishes with their greens
* A bunch of kale
* A large head of wavy-leafed lettuce
* One small adorable zucchini
* A bunch of parsley
* A potted basil plant

## What do you do with radishes, anyway?

To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of radishes normally - I'd certainly never
choose to buy them. So I took these radishes as something of a challenge:
could I make something of them that I would find at least palatable, or
maybe even tasty? Raw radishes were right out, so I started searching
around for ways of coooking them that might make them less spicy and gross.
Inspired by the presence of the parsley, I found a recipe for [blistered
radishes and parsley](http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/blistered-diced-radishes-with-parsley).

I was very pleasantly surprised: this takes the spice out of the radishes
and makes them into a similar texture to potatoes. The parsley works well
too. 8/10 palatable parseley-coated radishes.

I also used the greens to make another side: [stir fried radish greens](http://www.kalynskitchen.com/2008/06/recipe-for-spicy-stir-fried-radish.html)
and while it's nothing to write home about, I'd totally make it again if I
found myself with more green-affixed radishes.

## The rest of the share

In no particular order, the rest of the share became:

* Lettuce wraps with tuna salad
* Salad with apple and cranberry and tuna salad
* Three smoothies (one with lettuce, two with kale)
* A potted basil plant - I'm trying to make it happy in my sunniest window,
  but we'll see how that goes over the next few weeks.
* Haven't used the zucchini yet but whatever it gets used for should be
  both adorable and tasty.
