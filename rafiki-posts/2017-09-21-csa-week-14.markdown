## Meet the characters

This week's share contained:

* Leafy greens! Looks like Swiss chard, though don't quote me on that.
* Several more tomatoes
* A large red bell pepper
* An artichoke!
* Bag of green beans
* Either cabbage or iceberg lettuce, not sure which

## Vegetable of the week: artichoke
I think it's safe to say that I haven't eaten artichoke since it was served
to me at a dinner in 2014, mostly because I never really figured out how to
prepare it. Well, this is my chance!
