title: CSA Week 14

## Meet the characters

This week's share contained:

* Leafy greens! Looks like Swiss chard, though don't quote me on that.
EDIT: sure enough, it's actually spinach.
* Several more tomatoes
* A large red bell pepper
* ~~An artichoke!~~ Bok choy
* Bag of green beans
* Either cabbage or iceberg lettuce, not sure which

## Vegetable of the week: ~~artichoke~~ bok choy
My vegetable identification skills this week are struggling. What I
originally identified as artichoke was actually bok choy:

I ended up chopping it into large chunks and frying it up with my red
pepper and a couple of eggs. The leaves wilted and the bases stayed
delightfully crunchy. 7/10 quick and easy.

## The rest of the share

The rest of the share became:

* Steamed green beans
* Tomato with salt and pepper
* Tomato salad
* Several smoothies, which continue to be an excellent way to use mild
greens.
* Snacking on the rest of the red pepper

## Leftovers

Uh oh, the leftovers are back:

* Half a bok choy head
* That iceberg lettuce (uh oh, good thing it keeps longer than other
lettuces)
