title: CSA Week 12
---

## Meet the characters

This week's share contained:

* Yet _another_ head of lettuce
* A large tomato
* A giant red bell pepper. Seriously, I've never seen one so huge.
* An onion
* Five large carrots, yay!
* Two heads of sweet corn
* A large melon. On first glance it looks like a mix of a watermelon and an
acorn squash. More info once I have it.

Thanks as always to [Katchkie Farm](http://katchkiefarm.com/) for a
wonderful CSA this season!

## Fresh produce of the week: watermelon
That large melon? It was _definitely_ a watermelon. And it conveniently
fits precisely inside one of my usual containers. Yum.

## Salsa verde, continued

[Last week](2017-08-31-csa-week-11.html) I made some delicious salsa verde,
and I only used about half of it at the time. This week, to finish up those
poblano peppers and get a start on this week's tomato, I decided to
continue using it for delicious purposes. In particular, I went for some
[poblano
enchiladas](https://lifeasmom.com/poblano-chile-enchiladas-and-an-ultimate-recipe-swap/),
though I also added a bunch of tomato and cooked chicken because I had it
handy and like to have protein in meals when it's easy. I only ended up
making a third of that recipe, and with the above-mentioned additions it
was plenty for four meals for me.

The verdict: possibly the tastiest thing I have ever cooked. 10/10 will
absolutely make all the time.

## The rest of the share

In no particular order, the rest of the share became:

* Corn on the cob, again. There's simply no resisting this corn, it is
ridiculously tasty.
* Lettuce went into a few smoothies in the mornings.
* Those poblano enchiladas were so delicious that I used similar
ingredients to make at least three burritos.
* Watermelon became a snack.
* A salad for four (game night!)
* A tomato salad for two
* Some quinoa with carrots and beans and frozen peas. This was pretty okay,
but nothing to write home about. Still, not bad for 30 minutes and what
I had on hand.

## Leftovers
I'm not too concerned about the leftovers from this week, as most of them
will keep just fine.

* An onion
* Several carrots
* Some watermelon, still.
