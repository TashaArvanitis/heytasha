title: CSA Week 10
---

## Meet the characters

This week's share contained:

* A large head of lettuce, fluffier than usual
* A garlic bulb
* A small box of cherry tomatoes
* A single large tomato
* A substantial number of green (and yellow) beans
* Two button squashes
* Another squash
* Three carrots

Given that I was out of town from Friday afternoon through Wednesday
morning, this was a real challenge to use up!

## Blanching beans
Going into CSA season, I knew I would be freezing a lot of vegetables for
later. Somehow I managed to hold out a full nine weeks before learning how
to blanch things, but when I got back in town with only a day to spare
before another pickup, I felt it was time. I'd always viewed blanching as
some sort of deep magical trick, but it's really quite easy: boil some
water, throw chopped vegetables in for three minutes, douse them in cold
water and ice to stop them from cooking, and throw in the freezer. Easy,
and I'm excited to have these carrots and green beans ready to go in
the future. 8/10 fast and easy. Here's the before and after.

## The rest of the share

In no particular order, the rest of the share became:

* Quinoa with tomatoes, mozzarella, and fresh basil. That plant is a gift
that keeps on giving
* Tasty green/yellow beans as a snack, along with some cherry tomatoes
* A delicious tomato salad

## Leftovers

I have a few vegetables to reckon with next week - hopefully with a free
weekend I can play catch-up!

* Large tomato
* The whole lettuce head
* Button squashes
* That garlic feels like it doesn't count - I always take a long time to
use up garlic and it ought to stay good for a while.
