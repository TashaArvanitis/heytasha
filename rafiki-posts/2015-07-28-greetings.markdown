title: Greetings!
---

Hello, and welcome to my personal repository for various ramblings! In
general, physics- and computer-related things will end up on my [technical
blog](/archive.html), and pretty much anything else I write and want to
share will end up here. My interests vary based on the time of year and
what I'm in the mood for, but some possible topics that might make an
appearance or two include:

* Bike maintenance - I've been working in a bike shop and learning about
  just how magical bikes are, and really enjoy building, maintaining, and
  fixing bicycles of all sizes, shapes, and colors.
* Ultimate (Frisbee) - As a longtime player and occasional captain, I have
  a lot of thoughts and feelings about Ultimate.
* New York City - where I recently moved and am excitedly exploring.
* Early modern Europe and the Middle East - I got engrossed in history
  about a year ago and continue to read and learn all sorts of interesting
  things!

That's all for now! Welcome, and thanks for reading.
