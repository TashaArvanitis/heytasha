title: About
---
I'm currently an undergraduate at Harvey Mudd College,
where I'm studying physics and computer science, and
majoring in the former. I get excited about particle physics,
the Renaissance, and interesting computational problems,
among other things.

In my free time, I enjoy playing Ultimate (Frisbee),
flying stunt kites, and spending time in the mountains.
