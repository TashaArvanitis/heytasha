title: About
---
I'm a recent graduate of Harvey Mudd College, where I studied physics and
computer science, and majored in the former. I get excited about particle
physics, the Renaissance, and interesting computational problems.

In my free time, I enjoy playing Ultimate (Frisbee), repairing bikes, and
spending time in the mountains.

For more details, feel free to check out my [resume](/resume.pdf "Resume").
