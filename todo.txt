TO DO
Create new non-root users
    - myself

Fix background somehow.
  - mostly done, but need to concoct a background color that isn't awful

Hakyll things
  - Set up tex a bit nicer:
    * centered equations, align, etc.
    * don't change line height when the line contains math
  - Set up fancy image migrating so blog posts can stay close to their
    affiliated images
  - Make some other compilers
    * TeX
    * ipynb?
    * scholarly markdown - this would be so nice.......

Figure out a general layout
  - Potentially a sidebar for archive links etc eventually.
  - Make the css be browser-width-dependent (it's okay now, but not great)

Generate content
  - Ultimate stuff
    * Highlights
    * Coaching/captaining tips
  - Blog would be cool eventually
    * Physicsy stuff
      - Solar fusion
      - Kaons -> move post from tex writeup
      - Clinic project
    * Interesting softwarey things
      - Gazelles? How this blog works?
  - Personal blog
    * History etc (environmental history?)

    CSS.

Git stuff
