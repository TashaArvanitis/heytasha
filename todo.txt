TO DO
Create new non-root users

Hakyll things
  - Get preview server working again
  - Set up tex a bit nicer:
    * centered equations, align, etc.
    * don't change line height when the line contains math
  - Set up fancy image migrating so blog posts can stay close to their
    affiliated images
  - Make some other compilers
    * TeX
    * ipynb?
    * scholarly markdown - this would be so nice.......

Layout tweaks
  - Nice sidebar, and some sort of narrow-screen option for displaying
    information there.
  - Fix weird Safari bug in which moving from small screen to wide-screen
    mode causes the header (logo and navigation) to drop below the bottom
    of the header area. Works fine on refresh though...
