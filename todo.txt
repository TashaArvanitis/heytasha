TO DO
Create new non-root users
    - myself

Fix background somehow.
  - mostly done, but need to concoct a background color that isn't awful

Figure out a general layout
  - Tabs on side/top for different things (tabs, yes. different things? not yet)
  - Potentially a sidebar for archive links etc eventually.
  - Make the css be browser-width-dependent (it's okay now, but not great)

Generate content
  - Ultimate stuff
    * Highlights
    * Coaching/captaining tips
  - Blog would be cool eventually
    * Physicsy stuff
    * Interesting softwarey things
  - Impossible List
    * Fitness
      > goals regarding fitness
      > learn more about fitness-related things (SCIENCE)
    * Ongoing learning stuff
    * Education something something
      > learn more about lower education
      > contribute to it somehow
    * Opensource things

Fancier web stuff
  - Set up Google Analytics
  - Use SCSS instead of raw CSS - more like a language and less like, well,
    CSS.

Git stuff
  - Move vim ignoring things to a global git config
