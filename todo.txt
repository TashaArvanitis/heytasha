TO DO
Create new non-root users
    - myself

Fix background somehow.
  - mostly done, but need to concoct a background color that isn't awful

Figure out a general layout
  - Custom header (kinda almost done)
  - Tabs on side/top for different things (tabs, yes. different things? not yet)
  - background, layout of information (still working on a background,
    layout is still up for grabs)

Version control website from computer, have a sync.sh that rsync's
everything everywhere

Generate content

Fancier web stuff
  - Clean up the CSS. It's all over the place.
  - Override the default 404, that's a really lame page (.htaccess in
    /var/www, I believe...oooor, don't slow down the server as much and use
    httpd main server config file)
  - Get templating up and running with hakyll
  - Timeliney thing?
  - Use SCSS instead of raw CSS - more like a language and less like, well,
    CSS.
