I'm excited to share that I'll be speaking at the Grace Hopper Celebration
of Women in Computer Science this week in Houston, TX. My presentation,
titled "Accurate Physics-Based Models for Biomolecular Simulations," will
be on Thursday morning at 9am. I'll be discussing the application of some
cool data science techniques to molecular modeling, including how physical
and chemical intuition can inform our data analysis, and how data science
can actually provide us with new insights into the underlying physics. 
Hope to see you there!
